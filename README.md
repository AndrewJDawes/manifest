## 1. Install Local Manifest with Docker

> [!NOTE]
> Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
>
> - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
> - [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1. Clone this project repository.
2. Navigate to the repository folder by using the `cd` commands.
3. Go to folder `conjur-tooling`:

   ```bash
   cd conjur-tooling
   ```

4. Start the Docker container by using the below command. You may need to use `sudo` if you don't have permission to run docker-compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   _This command will download the necessary Docker image if it doesn't exist locally and start the container._

5. Create an account named `default`:

   ```bash
   docker exec conjur_server conjurctl account create default > admin-data
   ```

6. Log in as the **admin** user using the `API key for admin` key from the `admin-data` file. Replace `{api-key}` with this key.

   ```bash
   docker exec -it conjur_client conjur init -u https://proxy -a default --self-signed
   docker exec conjur_client conjur login -i admin -p {api-key}
   ```

7. Set your own admin password:

   ```bash
   docker exec conjur_client conjur user change-password -p CONJUR_password1
   ```

8. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and setup your own variables or let the default values.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are running Conjur on a local machine, make sure that NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED is set to 0 in your environment
